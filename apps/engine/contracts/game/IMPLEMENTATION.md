# Game Logic Components and Systems Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of modular game logic components and systems for the Soroban ECS-based game contract.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Files Created

#### `src/components.rs`
- **Position Component**: Represents 2D coordinates (x, y) of entities
  - Serializes to 8 bytes (4 bytes per u32 coordinate)
  - Uses big-endian encoding for deterministic cross-platform behavior
  - Implements `ComponentTrait` from soroban-ecs
  
- **Health Component**: Represents health points of entities
  - Serializes to 4 bytes (u32)
  - Uses big-endian encoding
  - Implements `ComponentTrait` from soroban-ecs

Both components include:
- Comprehensive documentation
- Unit tests for serialization/deserialization
- Component type identifiers

#### `src/systems.rs`
- **MovementSystem**: Handles entity position updates
  - `update_position()`: Updates position with delta values (dx, dy)
  - `teleport()`: Sets entity to specific coordinates
  - `manhattan_distance()`: Calculates distance between positions
  - Uses saturating arithmetic to prevent overflow/underflow
  - Clamps coordinates to non-negative values
  
- **CombatSystem**: Manages entity health and combat
  - `apply_damage()`: Applies specified damage amount
  - `attack()`: Standard attack dealing 10 damage
  - `heal()`: Restores health points
  - `is_alive()` / `is_dead()`: Health state queries
  - `set_health()`: Sets health to specific value
  - `update_health()`: [DEPRECATED] Backward compatibility function
  - Uses saturating arithmetic to prevent underflow

Both systems include:
- Comprehensive documentation with usage examples
- Unit tests for all methods
- Deterministic integer-only operations (blockchain-safe)

### 2. Updated Files

#### `src/lib.rs`
- Removed inline component and system definitions
- Added module declarations for `components` and `systems`
- Re-exported components and systems for public API
- Added `GamePosition` alias for backward compatibility
- Enhanced documentation for contract functions:
  - `move_entity()`: Documents movement behavior
  - `attack_entity()`: Documents combat and death mechanics

### 3. Backward Compatibility

To ensure existing tests and code continue to work:
- `GamePosition` re-exported as alias for `Position`
- `CombatSystem::update_health()` added as deprecated wrapper for `attack()`
- All existing contract functions maintain same signatures

## Key Features

### Modularity
- Components and systems are in separate, focused files
- Easy to extend with new components (e.g., Armor, Speed)
- Easy to extend with new systems (e.g., InventorySystem, QuestSystem)

### Determinism
- All operations use integer arithmetic only
- No floating-point operations (not supported in Soroban)
- Saturating arithmetic prevents overflow/underflow
- Big-endian encoding ensures cross-platform consistency

### Documentation
- Every component and system has detailed rustdoc comments
- Usage examples for all public methods
- Clear parameter and return value descriptions

### Testing
- 20 unit tests in components.rs and systems.rs
- 27 integration tests in tests/game.rs (all passing)
- Tests cover normal operation and edge cases
- Backward compatibility verified

## Contract Functions

### Entity Management
- `init()`: Initialize contract
- `spawn_entity(x, y)`: Create entity at position with 100 health
- `despawn_entity(id)`: Remove entity
- `entity_count()`: Get live entity count
- `dead_entity_count()`: Get dead entity count

### Movement System Integration
- `move_entity(id, dx, dy)`: Move entity by delta values
- `get_entity_position(id)`: Query entity position

### Combat System Integration
- `attack_entity(id)`: Attack entity (10 damage)
- `get_entity_health(id)`: Query entity health

## Testing

All tests pass successfully:

```bash
# Unit tests (components and systems)
cd apps/engine/contracts/game
cargo test
# Result: 20 tests passed

# Integration tests
cd apps/engine
cargo test --test game
# Result: 27 tests passed

# WASM build
cd apps/engine/contracts/game
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
# Result: Build successful
```

## Future Extensibility

The modular structure makes it easy to add:

### New Components
```rust
pub struct Inventory(pub Vec<ItemId>);
pub struct Speed(pub u32);
pub struct Armor(pub u32);
```

### New Systems
```rust
pub struct InventorySystem;
impl InventorySystem {
    pub fn add_item(inventory: &Inventory, item: ItemId) -> Inventory { ... }
}

pub struct SpeedSystem;
impl SpeedSystem {
    pub fn calculate_movement(speed: &Speed, distance: u32) -> u32 { ... }
}
```

## Implementation Notes

1. **Storage Optimization**: Entity data stored as tuples for efficiency
2. **TTL Management**: Persistent storage uses 30-day TTL for ledger efficiency
3. **Atomic Operations**: Entity counters use separate storage for fast access
4. **Death Handling**: Dead entities removed from storage and counted separately

## Compliance with Requirements

✅ Created `components.rs` with Position and Health components  
✅ Created `systems.rs` with MovementSystem and CombatSystem  
✅ Updated `lib.rs` to integrate components and systems  
✅ Exposed `move_entity` and `attack_entity` contract functions  
✅ All systems are deterministic (no floating-point, no random)  
✅ All tests pass  
✅ Comprehensive documentation with usage examples  
✅ Modular design supports future extensions
