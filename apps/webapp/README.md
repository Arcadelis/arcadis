## 🏃 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js (v18 or higher)](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Clone and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/arcadelis.git
   cd arcadelis/apps/webapp
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   bun dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## 🏗 Architecture

The web application follows a structured component-based approach:

- **Layout Components**: Base layout structure (`components/layout/`)
- **Shared Components**: Reusable UI elements (`components/shared/`)
- **Section Components**: Page-specific sections (`components/sections/`)
- **UI Components**: Basic UI building blocks (`components/ui/`)

### Deployment

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
