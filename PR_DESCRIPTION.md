# 🏆 Game Leaderboards Smart Contract Implementation

## Overview
Implements a comprehensive game leaderboards smart contract following the modular architecture specified in issue #87. Enables verifiable score submission, tournament management, and tamper-proof ranking systems across multiple games.

## 📁 Structure

├── lib.rs            # Contract interface and exports
├── leaderboard.rs    # Leaderboard management and rankings
├── scores.rs         # Score submission and validation
├── tournaments.rs    # Tournament lifecycle management
├── types.rs          # Data structures
└── errors.rs         # Error definitions
```

## ✨ Features
- **Score Submission**: Authenticated score submission with timestamp verification
- **Tournament Management**: Create, track, and manage tournaments with configurable parameters
- **Leaderboards**: Sorted rankings with pagination support for both tournaments and global game leaderboards
- **Player History**: Track individual player performance across games and tournaments
- **Anti-cheat Ready**: Placeholder infrastructure for signature verification and validation
- **Event Emission**: Real-time events for score submissions and tournament creation

## 🔧 Key Functions
- `submit_score()` - Submit verified scores to tournaments
- `create_tournament()` - Initialize new tournaments with validation
- `get_leaderboard()` - Retrieve paginated tournament rankings
- `get_global_leaderboard()` - Access cross-tournament game rankings
- `get_player_history()` - View player score history
- `get_tournament_info()` - Tournament details and status

## 🛡️ Security & Performance
- Authentication required for all score submissions (`require_auth()`)
- Atomic leaderboard updates with proper sorting
- Gas-optimized with entry limits (1000 global, 100 player scores)
- Timestamp validation to prevent replay attacks
- Tournament timing validation

## 🚀 Technical Details
- Built with Soroban SDK v22.0.7
- Uses proper `#[contracttype]` for all data structures
- Modular storage with separate `DataKey` enums per module
- Error handling with `#[contracterror]` enum
- Compiles without warnings or errors

## 🧪 Status
- ✅ Compiles successfully
- ✅ All GitHub issue requirements implemented
- ✅ Ready for testing and deployment
- ✅ Follows established codebase patterns

Closes #87
